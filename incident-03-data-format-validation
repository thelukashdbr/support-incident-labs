# Incident 03 – XML to JSON Data Validation Issue

## 🟢 Scenario
An integration started failing after receiving data in XML format that was being converted into JSON for processing by downstream services.

## 🟡 Observed Symptoms
- Data parsing errors
- Missing or null fields in processed requests
- Integration failures reported by the client

## 🔵 Investigation Steps
1. Inspected incoming XML payloads
2. Compared XML structure against expected schema
3. Verified XML to JSON conversion logic
4. Identified inconsistencies in field naming and data types
5. Reproduced the issue using sample payloads

## 🔴 Root Cause
The XML payload contained optional fields that were not consistently mapped during the XML to JSON conversion, leading to missing required values in the processed JSON.

## 🟣 Resolution
- Adjusted validation rules for incoming XML
- Improved conversion mapping logic
- Added defensive checks for missing fields
- Retested the integration with corrected payloads

## ⚫ Prevention
- Introduced schema validation for incoming XML
- Updated integration documentation
- Recommended standardized payload formats to clients
