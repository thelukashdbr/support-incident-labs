# Incident 02 – Suspicious API Traffic and Credential Management

## 🟢 Scenario
Monitoring alerts identified an abnormal increase in API requests coming from a specific integration. The traffic pattern suggested possible misuse or misconfiguration of credentials.

## 🟡 Observed Symptoms
- Sudden spike in request volume
- Repeated malformed requests
- Increased error rates impacting system stability
- Potential risk to API performance

## 🔵 Investigation Steps
1. Analyzed request logs and traffic patterns
2. Identified the source integration and associated credentials
3. Reviewed request payloads and headers
4. Evaluated potential impact on system performance and security
5. Assessed whether the behavior aligned with documented API usage

## 🔴 Decision Process
Based on the analysis, the behavior posed a risk to platform stability. A decision was made to temporarily block the affected credentials while further clarification was requested from the client.

## 🟣 Resolution
- Temporarily blocked the API credentials to prevent further impact
- Contacted the client with a clear technical explanation of the issue
- Assisted the client in identifying misconfiguration on their side
- Re-enabled credentials after validation and confirmation

## ⚫ Prevention
- Improved monitoring thresholds for abnormal traffic
- Updated client-facing documentation
- Established a clear internal decision-making flow for credential blocking
