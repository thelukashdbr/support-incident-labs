# Incident 01 – OAuth Token Expiration Causing API Failures

## 🟢 Scenario
A SaaS platform started receiving reports of failed API requests from external integrations. The issue was intermittent and occurred mostly during peak usage hours.

## 🟡 Observed Symptoms
- API requests returning HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)
- Increased error rate in monitoring dashboards
- Webhook deliveries failing sporadically
- Users reporting integration instability

## 🔵 Investigation Steps
1. Reviewed application and API gateway logs
2. Identified recurring authentication errors related to expired tokens
3. Reproduced the issue using Postman with expired OAuth tokens
4. Validated token expiration and refresh behavior
5. Checked integration documentation and configuration

## 🔴 Root Cause
OAuth access tokens were expiring under high load, and the token refresh process was not being triggered correctly in certain edge cases.

## 🟣 Resolution
- Updated token refresh logic to handle expiration properly
- Retested API calls with valid and expired tokens
- Confirmed successful authentication flow
- Monitored logs after the fix to ensure stability

## ⚫ Prevention
- Added monitoring alerts for authentication-related errors
- Improved API documentation regarding token lifecycle
- Recommended proactive token validation for integrations
